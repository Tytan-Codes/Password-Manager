# Password-Manager
## IMPORTANT!

Run these commands to install↓↓↓: 

```
git clone https://github.com/Tytan-Codes/Password-Manager.git
py -m pip install requirments.txt
py keyMaker.py
rm keyMaker.py
py main.py
```

Once you have done that, your encryption key is stored in __key.key__ copy that key, that key in the only way you're decryping those passwords! Each time you run keyMaker.py, the output of it is totaly different everytime, so once you've generated that key, no one else in the __world__ can get that same key.
